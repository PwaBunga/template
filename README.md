# PWA Bunga!

Welcome to the PWA Bunga! project, a modern, modular and intuitive front-end template for fast and efficient development of websites and Progressive Web Apps.

Whether you're a beginner or an experienced developer, this front-end template will help you save time and focus on creating specific features for your site or application, rather than setting up the basic architecture.

## Contents of PWA Bunga!

This front-end template is designed in a modular way and consists of three main modules: Starter, CSS, and PWA.

### PWA Bunga! Starter

The Starter module provides the basic files and folders to quickly start a website or PWA project. This includes resource folders, an HTML template, 404 and 403 error pages, an htaccess file, favicons in .ico, .svg or .png formats, as well as empty CSS and JS files that can be filled according to your needs.

### PWA Bunga! CSS

The CSS module includes a base CSS file with best practices, HTML element normalization, ergonomic improvements, and reset to improve consistency and compatibility across browsers, as well as to make the developer's work easier.

### PWA Bunga! PWA

The PWA module provides files and instructions to transform your website into a Progressive Web App (PWA). This includes the webmanifest file that contains application metadata, icons for the home screen, the service worker file that allows the application to work offline, a JavaScript file to enhance the user experience, and an optional CSS file to customize the user interface.
